# natools

A collection of tools for playing with numbers, data structures, algorithms...

## libbaas
A library holding basic data structures (eg: list, tree, hashtable, heap, graph,
vector, ...) as well as some basic sorting, bignum, bits, string...  algorithms.

## libparser
* a simple scanner that can go through chars, files, streams extracting parts.
* a small lexer capable of tokenizing identifiers, numbers, and math operators.
* a parser that understands operator-precedence grammars and a math sample one.

## libna
Miscelanous math functionality...
* combinatronic functions (eg: factorial, combinations, permutations)
* numerical calculus functions (eg: derivate, integrate by simpson)
* root finders for non-linear equations (eg: newton, secant, bisection)
* interpolation (eg: newton, lagrange, finite_differences)
